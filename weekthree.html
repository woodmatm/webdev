    <h2>9/17/2021 Blog Post</h2>
    <p id="home"><a href="index.html">Home</a></p>
    <p> This week I learned so much about using flexbox to sort my html code through
        CSS. Flexbox was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method 
        that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful 
        alignment capabilities. I found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox">this article</a>
        by Mozilla, that along with our book taught me different ways I could organize
        my webpages and the data within them. The main two CSS elements I learned about
        are justify-content and align-items. The CSS justify-content property defines how 
        the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis 
        of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container. The CSS align-items
        property defines the default behavior for how items are laid out along the cross axis.
        Throughout the week I struggled to get the hang of the concepts but after loads of practice
        by either playing Flexercise or just doing some simple trial and error, I feel alot better
        with the progress I have made.

    <div id="code">
    <pre>
        &lt;div class="parent">
            &lt;span class="child"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="child"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="child"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="child"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="child"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="child"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        .parent {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
            background-color: black;
            color: white;
            height: 200px;
        }
        
        .child {
            margin: 25px;
            padding: 10px;
        
            font-size: 44px;
            background-color: red;
        }
    </pre>

        I wanted to see more that I could do with Flexbox so I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwWHL3RyQgk">this video</a>
        that shows you different ways to make a navigation bar using Flexbox. I was specifically interested in this video because I believe
        it will come in handy when I make the navigation bar for my static webpage. I have made a navigation bar before but what I liked about
        the ones in the video were their sleek design and the code to make them is very easy to read now that I understand Flexbox. I also decided
        to make a favicon for my blog because I saw it was a requirement for our static site. I had to convert my png file to an ico to make it work
        but I love how simple they made it for me to insert a favicon for all my pages.
