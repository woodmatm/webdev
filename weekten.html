    <p> This week I learned about how to use React Router and how it is an important part of any React project. 
        When you build single page applications, you’ll use routes to separate your application into usable pieces 
        that users can access easily and consistently. Using routes becomes very useful for project 3 where we need
        to route our database information to the react app. A route's component is rendered when that route matches the URL. 
        The router will inject several properties into your component when it's rendered such as parameters, location of url,
        and the route. We use react routers to prevent a page refresh, this is one increasingly common way of having a more seamless 
        user experience. You don't have to deal with flashes on the screen everytime you try to allocate new information.
        React router also allows the user to utilize browser functionality like the back button and the refresh page while maintaining 
        the correct view of the application.

    <div id="code">
    <pre>
        export default function Grades() {
            const { path } = useRouteMatch();
            return (
                Grades
                Switch
                  Route path={`${path}/ART`}
                    ART
                  Route
                  Route path={`${path}/CS`}
                    CS
                  Route
                Switch
            );
          }
    </pre>

        This week I found this <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-handle-routing-in-react-apps-with-react-router">
            article</a> which takes you through the step by step process of how to use router within your react app. I used
            this tutorial to help me get a good start on my final project. I learned that as you start to separate your components into routes, 
            you’ll be able to take advantage of code splitting, preserving state via query parameters, and other tools to improve the user experience.
            It will be nice to not have to refresh everytime I make a request to my database because it wouldn't make my app look good.
            I am glad we dicussed routers in class because I didn't know how to do this otherwise, now my react app should run smoothly with my database
            to make for a good looking project.
