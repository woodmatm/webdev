    <h2>9/24/2021 Blog Post</h2>
    <p id="home"><a href="index.html">Home</a></p>
    <p> This week I learned about how positioning is essential when it comes to building complex interfaces. There are 5 different 
        positioning types static, relative, fixed, absolute, and sticky. I have used a couple of these before learning about them
        this week, for example I have used the fixed position for the footer of my main blog page so that it will never move from
        the bottom of the screen. Once the elements position type is set we can use the right, left, top,
        and bottom properties to place items exactly where we want. This tool makes it easy to layout your webpage exactly how you
        see fit. My favorite position is the sticky position because once you scroll to where a div with the stick property should
        be off of the screen it sticks to that part of the screen so that it will always be present. The image at the bottom of this
        blog post gives a great graphic example of all of the positioning properties so I will keep this in mind when using these 
        properties within my static website.

            width: 100px;
            height: 100px;
            background-color: red;
            position: relative;
            animation-name: shift;

            align-items: center;

        }
        
        @keyframes shift {
            0%   {background-color:red; left:0%}
            50%  {background-color:blue; left:50%}
            100% {background-color:red; left:100%}
          }

    <p>
        Now that I have been in this class for a couple of weeks, my youtube recommendations give me a lot
        of CSS and HTML videos. I have seen several videos of some of the insane animations some developers
        can make using just simple CSS and HTML so I thought I would dive in and learn some simple animations.
        I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp">this website</a> to make a simple
        animation of a box moving from left to right while changing colors. I decided to actually implement my
        code onto the screen and show my code snippit along with it. Hopefully in the future we touch on animation
        and I can make something more advanced than this.
