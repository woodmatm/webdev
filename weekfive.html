    <p> This week I learned a lot about Javascript and how I can use it to advance my html code. I can use it to
        add lots of interactive behavior to my webpages. Javascript, CSS, and HTML is the most dynamic trio when it comes
        to web development. Javascript is the only programming language native to the web browser and has lots of functions
        that makes it easy for programmers to interact with. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript makes
        everything come to life. I thought it was really cool using fetch on JSON data to extract it and modify it. I feel like
        this will be very useful when we start to do some backend using databases to recieve our data and sort through it.

    <div id="code">
    <pre>
        const lateGrades = [100, 94, 86, 90, 98, 78];

        lateGrades.map(function(item){
            return item * 0.9; // late penalty of 10%
        });

        // returns [90, 85, 77, 81, 88, 70]
    </pre>

        I decided to look up some of the most used methods in javascript to help familirize myself with the language since
        I haven't used javascript all that much before. I found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/7-javascript-methods-that-will-boost-your-skills-in-less-than-8-minutes-4cc4c3dca03f/">this</a>
        article that goes through several methods and give code snippit examples to help the reader get the grasp of how they work. One method that I found
        interesting was the reduce method that can be used for several applications such as executing promises sequentially, counts duplicates, performs calculations,
        etc. Usually to do most of these things you have to do them manually in other languages so I believe this method may become very valuable to know in the near future.
        There are several other functions on here like the map function that makes it super simple to modify a whole array and return a new one. After practicing with these on my own
        and doing our exercises this week, I feel like I am starting to understand Javascript better than I did a week ago which means I am making progress.
