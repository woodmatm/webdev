    <p> This week I learned about Redux Thunks in React. In Redux, Thunks are a pattern of writing functions with logic inside 
        that can interact with a Redux store's dispatch and getState methods. Thunks allow us to write additional Redux-related 
        logic separate from the User Interface. A Thunk does not execute the code itself, it just returns a function that will be
        called somewhere else. Once I figured out Redux Thunk then I needed to learn about middleware so I could implement the thunk.
        We use something like applyMiddleware(thunk), so that we can start dispatching actions asynchronously. The main reason we use
        Thunks is to return functions not just actions and one of the main uses for middleware is for handling actions that might not be 
        synchronous.

        import { FETCH_GITHUB_DATA } from './types';
        import axios from 'axios';

        const apiUrl = 'https://api.github.com/users/woodmatm';

        export const fetchData = (data) => {
        return {
            type: FETCH_GITHUB_DATA,
            data
        }
        };

        export const fetchGithubData = () => {
        return (dispatch) => {
            return axios.get(apiUrl)
            .then(response => {
                dispatch(fetchData(response.data))
            })
            .catch(error => {
                throw(error);
            });
        };
        };

    <h2 id="sample"> Example using Redux Thunk and Axios
    </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        When I was looking up examples of how to use Redux Thunk I stumbled across
        Axios. I found this <a href="https://intersog.com/blog/reactway/">article</a>
        that gave me more insight on what Axios is and how to use it within react and redux.
        Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. Axios makes it easy 
        to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations. It 
        can be used in plain JavaScript or with a library like React. I feel like using Axios 
        could be helpful in implementing our database from Project 2 into our app in Project 3.
        The reason I think it would be better to use Axios over the fetch we have done in class is
        because Axios has the ability to intercept HTTP requests while Fetch doesn't provide a way to intercept requests.
