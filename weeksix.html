    <p> This week I learned how to implement Express into JavaScript. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a 
        robust set of features for web and mobile applications. I used Express for GET requests and POST requests for Urban Dictionary. At first I really didn't
        understand how to get these to work but I finally got my port up and running. Once I took a step back to read into POST and GET I really understood the concept
        which helped me to be able to code it. It is more simple than it looks and will be very useful when I am trying to access data from a database. I am excited to
        implement the things I we did in class into my second project.

    <div id="code">
    <pre>
        const promises = [
            Promise.resolve(100)
            fetch("http://localhost/"),
            fetch("http://localhost/"),
        ];

        const statusPromises = await Promise.all(promises);
        console.log(statusPromises);
        console.log("Promises finished execution");
    </pre>
    <h2 id="sample">Wait until multiple promises are complete

    </div>

        I found an <a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/10-clever-javascript-tricks-that-every-developer-should-know-e0be92bcfe9">article</a>
         called 10 Clever JavaScript Tricks That Every Developer Should Know. The title really caught my attention so I obviously had to read more.
         One trick I found that could be very useful in the future was some code that allows you to wait until multiple promises are complete to proceed.
         It uses the await keyword which was also in our textbook and puts it to good use. Using this Promise.all will also return a rejected if any of the
         promises return a reject so using this can confirm all or nothing. You can use this trick if you are developing a micro-services architecture and you 
         need to fetch important, non-sequential data from multiple endpoints as fast as possible.
