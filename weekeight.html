    <p> This week I started to understand more about how Stores work in React. I started working through the example QuoteBase and it taught
        me why we use React. I love the way that React JS plays in perfectly with HTML and CSS that we learned earlier in the course. I am still
        working through how to update and persist the store and plan on starting my own implementation of the React App this week. I am excited to
        be able to connect the React App with my database and see what kind of App I can make for the final project. My database currently holds 
        student grades so I will be trying to make the next Canvas app. I think it is really nice how we will be able to style our App using CSS
        because I believe I have a good grasp on how I would want my app to look.

    <div id="code">
    <pre>
    import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

    function useOnline () {
        const [online, setOnline] = useState(navigator.onLine)

        function offlineHandler () {
            setOnline(false)
        }

        function onlineHandler () {
            setOnline(true)
        }

        useEffect (() => {
            setOnline(navigator.onLine)
            window.addEventListener('online', onlineHandler)
            window.addEventListener('offline', offlineHandler)

            return () => {
                window.removeEventListener('online', onlineHandler)
                window.removeEventListener('offline', offlineHandler)
            }
        }, [])

        return online
    }

    export default useOnline;

    <h2 id="sample"> React Hook Example
    </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        This week I found this <a href="https://intersog.com/blog/reactway/">article</a> which talks about how Hooks in ReactJS which 
        is helpful when we want to reuse stateful logic between components. The advantages of using Hooks is they are easier to work 
        with and test, less lines of code and makes code look cleaner, and it makes your code more resuable. I feel like using a Hook 
        will be very useful in our last project so that the code doesn't become so cluttered. Since this will be my first real React app 
        I make, using Hooks will be very nice so I will be able to reuse alot of the  code without having to rewrite it. In my code snippit
        above I will show a slight example that I found online of how a Hook works and can be implemented. As you can see, it uses a Hook
        to detect whether someone is online or offline. This code uses useStatus to keep track of the user's connectivity, and uses useEffect
         to register event listeners for the events online and offline to set the state accordingly.
