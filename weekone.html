    <h2>9/3/2021 Blog Post</h2>
    <p id="home"><a href="index.html">Home</a></p>
    <p>This week I learned how to setup my first HTML blog webpage. I learned over 10 new tags that 
        I can use to improve the way my webpages look to my viewers and to help me organize all of 
        my source code. One of the most notible things I learned this week was how to make a webpage form
        for user input. Learning how you can connect your labels to your inputs within a form will be really good 
        for the future. I want to use what I learned to make a contact page for my own personal portfolio website.
        I also learned how I can collaborate with other developers using Live Share. It is one of the most responsive
        collaboration tools I have seen.

    <div id="code">
    <pre>
        &lt;form&gt;
            &lt;label for="fname"&gt;First name:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;label for="lname"&gt;Last name:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Wayne"&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    </pre>
    <h2 id="sample">Here is my sample code of making a simple first name and last
        name entry box with attached labels

        I needed some help figuring out how to link serveral pages onto the home page of my blog so people could 
        see all of my blog posts seperate. I found <a id="video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSSHlOe47s&t=0s">this video</a> which
        clearly explained exactly how to make these pages and link them. The video showed how to use this knowledge to make a 
        navigation bar at the top of a webpage. I believe this will come in handy when I am making my own websites in the future. He showed
        some CSS code which made me excited that we will be learning CSS next week. I used some box model methods here to make all of my blog
        content more central to the page.
