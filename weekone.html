    <h2>9/3/2021 Blog Post</h2>
    <p>This week I learned how to setup my first HTML webpage. I learned over 20 new tags that I can use to improve 
        the way my webpages look to my viewers. One of the most notible things
        I learned this week was how to make a form. Learning how you can connect
        your labels to your inputs within a form was really good for the future.
